- 👋 Hi, I’m @joem5636
- 👀 I’m interested in Python [or at least Raspberry Pi] audio filtering using 
realtime sampling so that I can translate high sudio frequencies [say 5kHz to 
12kHz -- bird dong limits] to my audible range [say 100 to 5kHz]. 
My research says FFT can do this easily but the hangup is not introducing 
glitches, so I need a practical Overlap/Add implementation. STFT/ISTFT do most 
of this, but not the continuous part. The actual filtering is [relatively] 
trivial -- the continuous part doesn't seem to exist [yet].
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to fo continuoud Overlap/Add aufio processing. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a continuous Overlap/Add project.
