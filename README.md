- Hi, Iâ€™m @joem5636
- Iâ€™m interested in Python [or at least Raspberry Pi] audio filtering using 
realtime sampling so that I can translate high audio frequencies [say 5kHz to 
12kHz -- bird song limits] to my audible range [say 100 to 4.5kHz]. 
My research says FFT can do this easily but the hangup is not introducing 
glitches, so I need a practical Overlap/Add implementation. STFT/ISTFT do most 
of this, but not the continuous part. The actual filtering is [relatively] 
trivial -- the continuous part doesn't seem to exist [yet].
- Iâ€™m currently learning how to do continuoud Overlap/Add audio processing. 
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a continuous Overlap/Add project.
